Overview:
Catflix is a web application that aims to provide users with a video streaming service, similar to Netflix. The app will allow users to browse, search and watch a variety of movies and TV shows. The app will also have basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user profiles, movies, TV shows, tags, and categories. The app will be built on Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and will have a responsive web design that ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.
Features:
•	User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out. 
•	Movie and TV Show Catalog: The app will have a large catalog of movies and TV shows, organized into categories such as action, adventure etc. 
•	Users can browse and search for titles, view description.
•	Superuser Dashboard: An admin dashboard will be provided for managing movies, TV shows, categories, and users.
Architecture:
The app will be built on Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. The Model layer will handle the database and define the objects (models) to be stored. The View layer will handle the logic, such as fetching data from the database, rendering templates, and handling user requests. The Template layer will handle the HTML/CSS for rendering the user interface.
Responsive Web Design:
The app will have a responsive web design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The design will be user-friendly, intuitive, and consistent, with a clean and modern interface.

Models: 
The 'models' module defines the following models for Catflix app:
1.	Category model:
•	Fields: name (CharField), description (TextField)
•	Defines a category for a movie or TV show.
•	Has a one-to-many relationship with the Movie model.
2.	Tag model:
•	Fields: name (CharField), description (TextField)
•	Defines a tag for a movie or TV show.
•	Has a many-to-many relationship with the Movie model.
3.	Movie model:
•	Fields: name (CharField), description (TextField), category (ForeignKey), tags (ManyToManyField), watch_count (IntegerField), file (FileField), preview_image (ImageField), date_created (DateTimeField)
•	Defines a movie that can be watched by users.
•	Belongs to a single category and can have multiple tags.
•	Keeps track of the number of times a movie has been watched by users.
•	Stores the file (i.e. the video file) and the preview image associated with the movie.
•	Has a date_created field that is automatically set to the current date and time when the object is created.
Overall, these models define the main entities in the Catflix app, and their relationships. The Category model defines the categories for the movies and TV shows, the Tag model defines the tags that can be associated with the movies and TV shows, and the Movie model defines the movies that can be watched by users.
Views:
1.	index_view(request): This view displays the home page of the website. It retrieves a list of categories to display and creates a dictionary that maps each category to its movies. It then limits the number of movies to PAGE_SIZE_PER_CATEGORY = 20 and returns the response with the data.
2.	register_view(request): This view handles user registration. It renders the registration page when the request method is GET, and it creates a new user and redirects them to the login page when the request method is POST.
3.	login_view(request): This view handles user login. It renders the login page when the request method is GET, and it logs the user in and redirects them to the home page when the request method is POST.
4.	logout_view(request): This view handles user logout. It logs the user out and redirects them to the home page.
5.	watch_movie_view(request): This view handles video playback. It retrieves the primary key of the movie the user wants to watch from the GET parameters, and it retrieves the movie with the given primary key from the database. It then renders the page with the video player for that movie.
Templates:
1.	templates/index.html:
•	The home page of the Catflix app.
•	Contains a header, navigation bar, and various sections (e.g. Popular Movies, Trending Now, Recently Added).
•	Each section displays a set of movie posters with their respective titles and brief descriptions.
index.html navigation:
The nav tag defines a container for the navigation bar, with the sub-nav class likely defining the bar's layout and styling.
The first element in the bar is a search form that allows users to search for movies within the app. The form tag creates the search form, with the action attribute defining the URL for the form's submission (likely the app's homepage). The {% csrf_token %} template tag adds a Cross-Site Request Forgery token to the form for security purposes. The {{ search_form.as_p }} template tag renders the search form's fields as HTML input elements, using the as_p attribute to render each field with a label and paragraph tag.
The second element in the bar changes depending on whether the user is logged in or not. If the user is logged in (request.user.is_authenticated is True), the bar displays the user's username and a logout button. The {{ request.user }} template tag outputs the user's username. The button tag creates a logout button, using the btn and btn-danger classes to define the button's styling. The button's href attribute points to the app's /logout URL.
If the user is not logged in (request.user.is_authenticated is False), the bar displays a register button and a login button. The button tags create the two buttons, using the btn, btn-outline-light, and btn-danger classes to define the buttons' styling. The buttons' href attributes point to the app's /register and /login URLs, respectively.
Index.html Main container:
The main container is a section of the HTML template that contains the main content of the page. In the context of the Catflix project, the main container displays the movie categories and their corresponding movies.
The code iterates over the data variable which contains a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a category and the corresponding movies in that category. The first for loop iterates over each category in the data variable, and for each category, it displays the category name using an h1 tag.
The second for loop iterates over each movie in the current category, and for each movie, it displays the movie's name and preview image. If the user is authenticated, it displays a link to watch the movie by setting the href attribute of an anchor tag to the watch view URL with the movie's primary key as a query parameter. Otherwise, it displays a link to the registration page.
The class="box" div is used to group each movie together and apply the desired styling.
2.	templates/login.html:
•	The login page of the Catflix app.
•	Contains a form with input fields for the user's email and password.
•	Includes a link to the registration page for new users.
3.	templates/register.html:
•	The registration page of the Catflix app.
•	Contains a form with input fields for the user's name, email, password, and confirmation of password.
Register and Login.html:
The section tag creates a container for the login page's content, with the main-container class defining the container's layout and styling.
The div tags define two additional containers within the section tag. The box class define the container for the login form.
The form tag creates a login form that is processed by the app's /login URL when the user submits the form. The {% csrf_token %} template tag adds a Cross-Site Request Forgery token to the form for security purposes.
The {% if wrong_credentials %} template tag displays an error message if the user enters invalid login credentials. The {{ login_form.as_p }} template tag renders the login form's fields as HTML input elements, using the as_p attribute to render each field with a label and paragraph tag.
Finally, the button tag creates a submit button for the login form, using the btn and btn-danger classes to define the button's styling.
4.	templates/watch_movie.html:
•	The page for watching a movie.
•	Displays the movie's preview image and video player.
•	Includes buttons for starting, pausing, stopping, and rewinding the video.
Static files:
1.	static/style.css:
•	Contains the CSS styles for the Catflix app's pages.
•	Defines the font, color scheme, and layout of the pages.
•	Defines the styling for the various HTML elements used in the templates.
2.	static/headers.css:
•	Contains the CSS styles for the header and navigation bar of the Catflix app.
•	Defines the layout and appearance of the header and navigation bar, including the logo, search and menu items.
The static files for Catflix app help to define the visual appearance of the pages and make them more appealing and user-friendly. They work in conjunction with the templates to create a cohesive and consistent user interface.
Conclusion:
Catflix is a simple web application that allows users to browse movies and watch them online. The application has some basic features such as user registration, authentication, and search functionality. The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, which is a great thing for novice users.
One of the strengths of this app is its simplicity. The app is easy to navigate, and the user interface is intuitive, making it easy for users to find what they are looking for. The use of Django, a powerful Python web framework, ensures that the application is secure and scalable.
However, there are some limitations to this application. For instance, the app only allows users to browse and watch a limited set of movies. It would be great if the app could expand its collection to include more movies and TV shows to attract more users.
Additionally, the application could use some more advanced features such as a recommendation system, user reviews, and ratings. These features would enhance the user experience and provide more engagement with the application.
Furthermore, the app has some potential security risks, such as the use of email as a username for user authentication. This practice is not recommended as it exposes user email addresses to potential attackers. It would be best if the app used a separate username field instead of using email as a username.
In conclusion, Catflix is a simple and easy-to-use application that provides users with basic features for watching movies online. While the application has some limitations, it can be improved by adding more advanced features and expanding its movie collection. Additionally, the app could use some security improvements to ensure the safety of user information.
